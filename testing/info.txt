When you run the test_all.py script with python3.8, you will be checking the following:

1) Python Version: Whether you are using Python 3.8 or not. If you are using Python 3.8, test is considered succesful. If not, test is considered failed.
2) Serial Library: Whether you have the pyserial library installed or not. This is checked by importing the serial library and listing the ports. If there is atleast one port found, test is considered succesful. If not, test is considered failed.
3) Display CV2 frame on screen: Whether you have the cv2 library installed or not. This is checked by importing the cv2 library and displaying a frame on the screen. If the frame is displayed without any errors, test is considered succesful. If not, test is considered failed. Yet one should be aware that the image is infact shown on the screen, since the test is not able to check this. This test is essentially a sanity check to see if the cv2 library is installed correctly and docker container is able to display images on the screen.
4) Webcam Test: Whether you have a webcam connected to the system or not. This is checked by importing the cv2 library and capturing a frame from the webcam. If the frame is captured without any errors, test is considered succesful. If not, test is considered failed. Yet one should be aware that the image is infact captured, since the test is not able to check this. This test is essentially a sanity check to see if the webcam is connected correctly and docker container is able to capture images from the webcam.
5) CUDA test: Whether you have the CUDA library installed or not. This is checked by importing the torch library and checking if the CUDA is available. If the CUDA is available, test is considered succesful. If not, test is considered failed.
6) ULTRALYTICS YoloV8-n pose test: Whether you have the ULTRALYTICS YoloV8-n pose model downloaded or not. This is checked by importing the model and performing detection on a sample image. If the detection is performed without any errors, test is considered succesful. If not, test is considered failed.
